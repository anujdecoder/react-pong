## User stories

1. As a player, I should be able to control my paddle with mouse.
2. The other player should be controlled by the computer.
3. The computer's paddle should be unbeatable. It should never miss the ball.
4. As a player, I have a score that increases everytime I hit the ball.
5. As a player, my level increases as I keep playing. My level increases by one for every 10 hit.
